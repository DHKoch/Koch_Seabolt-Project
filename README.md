# General Description
The Online Banking Inc. Application is a program that immitates a potentially real online banking application. The user has the option to login as the Manager or as a Customer. The user may also create an account with the bank through the application. The Manager is asked to enter the employee number and password that corresponds to the manager account. The manager does not have a file associated with the information, instead the manager information is hard coded into the program. Once logged in the manager can freeze user accounts or unfreeze them. The manager can also view and adjust the interest rates that effect the savings account in the system. When the manager is finished with his tasks he may log out and return to the main menu. 

If a customer wishes to login, the user will be asked to enter the account number for the specific account they would liek to login to. if the account number is valid the user will be asked to enter the password for the account. If the information for the user login is correct the menu for the user is displayed. The customer has the options of: View Balance, Deposit, Withdraw, Transfer, View Transaction Log, CLose Account and exit to the main menu. Viewing the balance of the account will display the current balance. If the account is a savings account then the current interest rate will also be displayed. If the user wishes to deposit into the account the amount input is checked and if correct will be deposited and added to the transaction lag. The withdraw option checks the amount input and also checks if the current balance is mor than the requested withdraw amount so that the account does not become overdrawn. If the amount requested passes the checks the transaction will proceed and be added to the transaction log. The transfer option will ask the user to enter the account number of the account they would liek to transfer to. If the account exists the customer is asked to enter the amount they would like to transfer. the amount entered goes through the same checks as if it were a withdraw. if the amount passes the checks the transfer will happen and both transaction logs of each accoutn will be updated. If the customer wishes to close the account they will be prompted again as to make sure that they want to close the account. If they do wish to close the account the information in the account will be cleared and the user will be exited to the main menu. 

If the user would like to make an account they will be asked to enter the desired information for the account they would like to create. once the accoutn has been created they are presented with the same menu as the logged on Customer explained above.
